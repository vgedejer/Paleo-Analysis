The original location, stated as ‘northwest of Clarks Ranch, from NW 1/4 Sec 35, T 4, R 19, west of the 3rd Meridian, Frenchman River Valley, Saskatchewan’, is incorrect. Tim Tokaryk (RSM) relocated the original site in the late 1980s (with the relocation being confirmed by the matching of a rib fragment collected at the site with a rib of the specimen, and residual plaster persisting at the site; T.T. Tokaryk, pers. comm., 2007). Located in LSD 11, Sec 2, T 5, R 19, west of the 3rd Meridian in south-western Saskatchewan (Fig. 3). The quarry is located on the north side of the Frenchman River Valley on the north-west facing side of a butte extending from the valley wall.

The uppermost St. Mary River Formation and lowermost Willow Creek Formation are both exposed along the river in this area. Due to the strongly upthrust and faulted condition of the bedrock strata in the area and the absence of obvious outcrops of the Battle Formation and Whitemud Member marker beds in the quarry area, it has been difficult to determine the precise stratigraphic position of the specimen in relation to the contact between the St. Mary River and Willow Creek formations. Nonetheless, existing geologic maps of the area suggest that the quarry occurs within the upper 30 m of the St. Mary River Formation [9]. This stratigraphic position is supported by the presence of the angiosperm palynomorph Scollardia trapaformis (D.R. Braman, personal communication) in the host matrix of TMP 2005.055.0001. S. trapaformis is diagnostic for upper beds of both the St. Mary River Formation and the combined Carbon and Whitemud members of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation (southern and central Alberta) [10, 11]. Carbon Member strata north of Drumheller have yielded the chasmosaurine Eotriceratops xerinsularis [10: Figure 3] and are assigned an age of 67.5–68.5 mega-annum (Ma) [10–12]. Given that well-established chronostratigraphic correlations across southern Alberta equate the upper Horseshoe Canyon Formation with the upper St. Mary River Formation (see Figure 9 in [13]), the holotype likely shares this same middle Maastrichtian age."
