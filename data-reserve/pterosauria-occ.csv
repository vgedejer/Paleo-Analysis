The SMNK was initially told that the pterosaur originated from a quarry at Hâqel, although doubts were raised during discussions with another local dealer. We were later informed that this fossil had probably not been removed from the quarry of Hâqel but was likely from the nearby locality of Hjoûla (Roy Nohra, personal communication). As Hjoûla is only ~4 km south of Hâqel it is conceivable that the fossil dealers and middle men were uncertain as to the specimen’s exact provenance. The sediments of Hâqel, however, contain a moderate amount of bioclasts and are noticeably whiter in colouration than those of Hjoûla, which are more micritic. A comparison of the grey limestone slab with other specimens housed at the SMNK leads us to propose the Early Cenomanian locality of Hjoûla as the true provenance of this specimen. This conclusion could be further confirmed by a thin section or petrographic analysis, but these were beyond the scope of this investigation."

The SMNK was initially told that the pterosaur originated from a quarry at Hâqel, although doubts were raised during discussions with another local dealer. We were later informed that this fossil had probably not been removed from the quarry of Hâqel but was likely from the nearby locality of Hjoûla (Roy Nohra, personal communication). As Hjoûla is only ~4 km south of Hâqel it is conceivable that the fossil dealers and middle men were uncertain as to the specimen’s exact provenance. The sediments of Hâqel, however, contain a moderate amount of bioclasts and are noticeably whiter in colouration than those of Hjoûla, which are more micritic. A comparison of the grey limestone slab with other specimens housed at the SMNK leads us to propose the Early Cenomanian locality of Hjoûla as the true provenance of this specimen. This conclusion could be further confirmed by a thin section or petrographic analysis, but these were beyond the scope of this investigation."

This extensive area of fossil digging is centred around 31°36’55.87”N – 4°15’42.67” W. A second important area of fossil digging, and lying slightly closer to the Taqrout plateau is within and adjacent to a sandstone quarry at Lamaaka at 31°38’51.13” N – 4°13’41.47” W.
